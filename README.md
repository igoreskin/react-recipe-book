React Recipe Book

React with Redux Middleware

This is a simple CRUD React application where you can create, read, update and delete cooking recipes. Async actions are used to send data to and receive data from an external API. Redux middleware is used to respond to and modify the state change.

Installation instructions

In the subfolder recipe-book-api run rake db:migrate, rake db:seed to seed the database. Then run rails s â€“p 3001 to launch the Rails server.
In another terminal window, in the subfolder recipe-book-client run nmp install && nmp start, the landing page will then pop up the browser.
